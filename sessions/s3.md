# Session 3
- Overview: Branching in git, Merging and Rebasing
- Keywords: `git`, `GitHub`, `local-repo`, `remote-repo`, `branch`, `commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `conflicts`, `git merge`, `git rebase`
- Learning outcomes:
  - What are branches in git?
  - What is merging?
  - What is rebasing?


## Detailed information:
- We have started the session with explanation of keywords, that branch in git are nothing but pointers that points towards change in software code.
- We prefer to work with branches to simulaniously work on different features of project or software code.
- Now, in order to keep your software code up-to date we generally, after completing one feature, we merge them into main branch.
- Generally, it happens that we never work on main branch because that is used for deployment or may be it carries stable version of software code.
- Now, merging two branches means taking changes of one branch into another.
- `git branch <branch name>` command is used to create new branch named `<branch name>`. Let's say it is given from branch `main` then new branch will contain all past commits of `main` branch till that commit point.
- `git merge` command is used to merge two branches in very simple way which creates new commit and merge two branches.
- `git merge <branch name>` is used from, let's say `main` branch then `<branch name>` is merged with `main` branch and vice versa.
- In contrast to merge, `git rebase` will also merge two branches but rather than making new commit, it will add commits of one branch onto another branch.
- `git rebase` is used to crate ideal working history in such a way that history will look clean and linear.


## Important commands:
  We have seen several basic commands that you must know while starting to work with git and GitHub, here are the commands listed that we have seen during this session.
  - git branch \<branch name>
  - git merge \<branch name>
  - git rebase \<branch name>

## Questions:
- Will be added soon!
