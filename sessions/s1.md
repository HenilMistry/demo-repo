- Overview: Basic information about git and GitHub
- Keywords: `git`, `GitHub`, `local-repo`, `remote-repo`, `branch`, `commit`, `git push`, `git pull`
- Learning outcomes:
  - What is git
  - What is GitHub
  - How to use GitHub
  - How to create repository on GitHub
  - Setting up git
  - Creating local repository
  - Connecting with remote repository
  - pushing and pulling changes
  - visualizing git


## Detailed information:
- We have seen that maintaining history of changes in software code is known as version controlling, the first every and most popular tools that helps us in version controlling was made by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) which is popularly known as git.
- [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/) is a tool that is being used when programmers want to work collboratively. Generally, there is term repository that is being referred to the directory in which git is tracking changes made to file.
- The repository which is there in your local machine that is called Local Repository and a repository which is hosted on network or on some remote servers that is called Remote Repository, GitHub is used to host remote repositories.
- If you have created local repository first, you may have used `git init` command, in that case you can add remote repository's URL using `git remote add <alias> <url>` command and them you need to set upstream branch using `git branch` command to connect with remote repository and using `git push` and `git pull` as a short hand of `git push <alias> <branch>` or `git pull <alias> <branch>` commands. 
- If you have created remote repositoy first, then you can use `git clone` command to save your time in creating local repository and setting up everything.
- `git status` command will tell you everthing about your repository, whether there are any untracked files, modified files, etc. Also, it will give you suggestions if there are any errors or warnings.
- `git add` command will put changes inside staging area before commit.
- Staging Area is a place where files are kept by git before recording a commit, basically before commit, you must put files inside staging area to record them in next commit.
- `git commit` command is used to make a commit and, it is recommended to use commit message with every commit so that it should clear the purpose of commit.
- `git push` command is used to publish local commits to remote repository.
- `git pull` command is used to publish remote commits to local repositoty.
- Idel workflow for contribution to collaborative project:
  - `git status` : to check the status of local repository.
  - `git pull` : to update your local repository.
  - `git commit` : to record the changes that you have contributed.
  - `git pull` : to make sure that there should not be any conflicts, if there are, make sure to resolv them before `git push`
  - `git push` : to publish your local contributions (commits) to remote repository.

## Important commands:
  We have seen several basic commands that you must know while starting to work with git and GitHub, here are the commands listed that we have seen during this session.
  - git init
  - git remote add \<alias> \<remote url>
  - git branch --set-upstream-to=\<alias>/\<branch> \<local branch>
  - git status
  - git log
  - git commit -m "\<commit message>"
  - git branch \<new branch name>
  - git checkout [branch | commit id]
  - git push
  - git pull
  - git pull --allow-unrelated-histories

## Questions:
1) What is the unrelated histories error in git ?
