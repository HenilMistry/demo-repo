## Detailed information:
- Several time, it will happen that you don't want to make a commit, whatever the reason but Let's say you want to use `git pull` or `git push`, in that case, it will not allow you to do that before making an commit or stashing your changes.
- Now, stashing in git means temporary hiding your changes or sort of ignoring them.
- `git stash` command will do that.
- `git stash pop` command will unhide all your chnages that has been stashed, this coommand may lead to conflict.
- Now, several times, it may happen that you want to contribute to someone's public repository but they might don't add you directly as a collborator. In such cases, you can fork the repository.
- Forking means making a copy of someone else's remote repository in your GitHub account. After forking repository, you can clone that and make your contribution.
- After that, you can create pull request to let actual owner know about your changes then it's upto that owner that whether they want to accept your changes or not.
