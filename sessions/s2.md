# Session 2
- Overview: Basic information about Conflicts and Resolution
- Keywords: `git`, `GitHub`, `local-repo`, `remote-repo`, `branch`, `commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `conflicts`
- Learning outcomes:
  - What are conflicts?
  - What are reasons for conflict?
  - How to resolve them?


## Detailed information:
- If we talk about conflicts in git, it is a condition where git cannot auto merge files because of different contents on same line on same file.
- There are several times when conflicts can occur:
  - while merging two branches
    - Let's say that there are two developers working on two different branches but somhow they can modify same file, let's say they wanted to add dependecy in some file, but due to totally different branch they may add different dependency on same line of file. In that case, git may confused to which line to keep? Manul resolution needed.
  - while `git pull` command
    - Let's say that two developers working remotely on same project and one of them just push their changes to remote repository and while other developer is trying to push their changes but before that he/she issue `git pull` command to make sure everything is up to date and let's say there is modification in one file which has been changed by this developer too. In that case, conflict may occur.
  - Sevarl other times conflict may occur
    - while `git push` command
    - while making a pull request     
    - while unstashing your local changes after `git pull`
  - The core reason for conflict to occur is that, modification on same line of same file.
- To resolve the conflicts you must manually go through files and look out for symbol stream `<<<<<<<<<<` after which your changes will be there until symbol stream `==========` and then upstream changes will be there until symbol stream `>>>>>>>>>>`
- You can keep both changes, keep any one of the changes, or you can discard both of them.
- After you do that, you can say that you have resolved the conflicts.
- If you were performing some kind of merge then you should make a commit after resolving conflict.


## Important commands:
  We have seen several basic commands that you must know while starting to work with git and GitHub, here are the commands listed that we have seen during this session.
  - git init
  - git remote add \<alias> \<remote url>
  - git branch --set-upstream-to=\<alias>/\<branch> \<local branch>
  - git status
  - git log
  - git commit -m "\<commit message>"
  - git branch \<new branch name>
  - git checkout <branch | commit id>
  - git push
  - git pull
  - git pull --allow-unrelated-histories
